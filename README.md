# Breast Cancer Classification  
**Breast Tumor Classification Using Random Forest Algorithm**  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to build a **Machine Learning** model to classify breast tumors as **benign** or **malignant**.  
We use the **Random Forest** algorithm due to its robustness in handling datasets with multiple features and its ability to provide insights into feature importance.  

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from **Scikit-learn**, which consists of:  
- **569 instances**  
- **30 numerical attributes** as predictive features  
- **2 target classes**:  
  - **WDBC-Malignant** (Cancerous)  
  - **WDBC-Benign** (Non-cancerous)  

## Dataset Characteristics  
This dataset contains various tumor characteristics, including:  
âœ… **Radius** (mean distance from the center to perimeter points)  
âœ… **Texture** (standard deviation of grayscale values)  
âœ… **Perimeter & Area**  
âœ… **Smoothness** (local variation in radius length)  
âœ… **Compactness** (perimeterÂ² / area - 1.0)  
âœ… **Concavity & Concave Points** (severity and number of concave portions)  
âœ… **Symmetry & Fractal Dimension**  

## Project Goals  
The main goal of this project is to **develop a Machine Learning model using Random Forest** to assist in **breast cancer diagnosis**.  

## Model Evaluation  
The model is evaluated using:  
ðŸ”¹ **Confusion Matrix** to assess prediction accuracy  
ðŸ”¹ **Feature Importance Analysis** to identify the most influential features  
ðŸ”¹ **Correlation Matrix** to understand relationships between features  

## Key Insights  
âœ” **Random Forest achieves high accuracy** in classifying benign and malignant tumors.  
âœ” **The most influential features** in classification are **tumor area, concave points, and perimeter**.  
âœ” **Correlation analysis shows strong relationships between some features**, which can be optimized further for better model performance.
